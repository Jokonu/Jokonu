- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jokonu
- 👀 I’m interested in the world and all around it. Especially though I am doing my doctoral studies with multivariate time series (MTS) data in the context of condition based maintenance on mechatronic systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use Autoencoder for MTS clustering and anomaly or drift detection with Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on improving open source software to enable machine learning algorithms being used for useful things.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
